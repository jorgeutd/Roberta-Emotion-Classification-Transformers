# Multi Class Text Classification (emotion detection) using ðŸ¤—transformers.

This repository demonstrates how to train an NLP model using transformers and datasets library together with a custom Amazon sagemaker-sdk extension to fine-tune a pre-trained transformer on Multi Class Text Classification.

You can access the fine tuned model at the [hub]: https://huggingface.co/Jorgeutd/sagemaker-roberta-base-emotion and test it yourself.
